As noted in the final part of [[Proof of Work]], when seen from the lens of [[Economic Security]], Proof of Stake is more or less the same as [[Proof of Work]], except it utilizes a less wasteful method to achieve verifiable execution of STF.

Jumping right into it, Proof of Work requires: 
- Any participant in the network to lock an amount of capital in a vault inside the protocol, where they themselves can no long access it
- In the event that is known they diverged from the STF, This capital is **slashed**

In a very similar manner to [[Proof of Work]], Proof of stake is a more pure form of [[Economic Security]] leading to [[Resilience]]. Because all authors are asked to lock a (hopefully significant) amount of capital *at stake* (therefore the name Proof of *Stake*), we can be sure that they execute the STF correctly and not diverge from the protocol.
