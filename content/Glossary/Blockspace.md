The measure of the quantity of verifiable computation that a blockchain can perform. Blockspace produced by different blockchain networks can also have different degrees of *quality*. Both in a [[Proof of Work]] and a [[Proof of Stake]] network, the quality of the blockspace is proportional to the [[Economic Security]] of the authors that produce the blocks.
