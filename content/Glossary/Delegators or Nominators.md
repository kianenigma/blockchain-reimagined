Entities in a [[Proof of Stake]] network that contribute an amount of capital to a one or more validators, but don't actually run the an authoring node or produce blocks, they only play a role in increasing [[Economic Security]]. In effect, they are willing to attest that the said validator(s) are honest.

[[Proof of Stake]] networks that allow this are called Delegated/Nominated Proof of Stake networks.

By convention, when an entity can just chose one validator to back, it is called **Delegation**. When multiple parties can be selected, it is called **Nomination**. Ideally, in Nominated Proof of Stake, an optimization process can split the total stake of a nominator
