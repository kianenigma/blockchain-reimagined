The set of rules in a blockchain that dictates:
- Who gets to author new blocks at any given point in time
- How to resolve Forks if they appear 
- How to incentivize the correct behavior in participants, and punish malicious behavior
- (possibly) determine when a block is determined [[Finality|Final]].
Examples are [[Proof of Work]] and [[Proof of Stake]].
