We need [[Authority]] and [[Trust]], because of our **scale**: We are simply too many humans to be able to directly trust one another.

Consider the following: 
- In a group 4 friends, we blindly trust each other based on personal knowledge, even if there is money involved. 
- In a group of 20, we easily rely on second-hand trust: if my friend trust them, so should I. 
- In a village of a few hundred, you already start to see the need for a leader, an authority, to settle disputes, should one arise. 
- When the size of the collective rises to millions, like a nation, we establish entire sets of organizations designed to establish trust:Â 
	- Banks: who owns credit and debit
	- Land registry: who owns what land
	- Patent registration: who owns which intellectual property
	- Regulatory bodies: oversee financial institutions
	- Tax authorities
	- Notaries

Therefore, the overall need for [[Authority]] is unavoidable when we live in large collectives.
