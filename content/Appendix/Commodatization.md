TODO: study the process of commoditization of a few more things. There has always been some abuse at first, but eventually it is a step forward for humanity. 

A few further examples of this: 
- People easily created multiple variants of Bitcoin itself
- Ethereum ICOs being an accessible equivalent to IPOs
- Decentralized Finance being an accessible equivalent to financial products
- Memecoins being an accessible equivalent to gambling

Consider how in each example, setting up the authority needed to execute the given action (a new bank, IPO, a financial product, casino) is quite hard to achieve in the realm of [[Trust#Human-based Trust| Human-based Trust]], yet is much easier in the world of [[Trust#Science-based Trust|Science-based Trust]].
